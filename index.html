  <h1 class="center-text"> Hello, I’m Ayca 👋</h1>
  <p class="center-text">Computer Science student building my personal website.</p>
  <p> My name is Ayça Aksu. I was born on January 11, 2007, in Ankara, Türkiye. I lived in Türkiye 
    for most of my life until I turned 18. I attended Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle in Ankara, 
    where I learned to speak French. After graduating from high school, I moved to France to pursue
    my higher education. I am currently studying at the University of Paris-Saclay, where I am 
    completing a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science.

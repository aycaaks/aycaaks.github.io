  <h1 class="center-text"> Hello, I’m Ayca 👋</h1>
  <p class="center-text">Computer Science student building my personal website.</p>
  <p> My name is Ayça Aksu. I was born on January 11, 2007, in Ankara, Türkiye. I lived in Türkiye 
    for most of my life until I turned 18. I attended Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle in Ankara, 
    where I learned to speak French. After graduating from high school, I moved to France to pursue
    my higher education. I am currently studying at the University of Paris-Saclay, where I am 
    completing a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science.

  <p> This website has no professional meaning. I'm just vibe coding and doing this for my own fun. 
    It will be kind of like my personal blog, showing my accomplishments, interests, etc...
